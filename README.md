## Main results

### Genetic regulation are mostly shared at mRNA and protein levels
* Correlation of QTLs at different omics levels
* Pi1 at different omics levels

### Genetic regulation signals at different omics levels implicate schizophrenia pathogenesis
* LDSC (QTL loci at different omics levels contribute to schizophrenia heritability)
  * [ ] figure 3-21
* MESC (integrating multi-omics data mediated the most heritability for schizophrenia)
  * [ ] table 3-24

### Running PrediXcan of different omics levels identify schizophrenia risk genes
* Correlation of PrediXcan r2s at different omics levels (Multi-SNP QTL)
* For TWAS risk genes, how many were in the conditional models?
  * [ ] figure 3-24

### Integrating genetic regulation of multi-omics levels identifies schizophrenia risk genes
* [ ] meta analysis of TWAS at differemt omics levels
* [ ] colocalization of TWAS signals at different omics levels
* [ ] Joint-omics TWAS using MR-JTI

### Functional support of the schizophrenia risk genes
*
