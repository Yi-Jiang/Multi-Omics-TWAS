## Main results

### Genetic regulation are mostly shared/unique at mRNA and protein levels

### Unique genetic regulation signals at different omics levels implicate schizophrenia pathogenesis
* [ ] LDSC and explanation
* [ ] MESC and explanation
* [ ] For TWAS risk genes, how many were in the conditional models?

### Integrating genetic regulation of multi-omics levels identifies schizophrenia risk genes
* [ ] meta analysis of TWAS at differemt omics levels
* [ ] colocalization of TWAS signals at different omics levels
* [ ] Joint-omics TWAS using MR-JTI

### Functional support of the schizophrenia risk genes
