## Main results

### Genetic regulation are mostly shared from mRNA to protein level
- [x] QTL effect sizes are highly correlated among eQTL, rQTL, and pQTL
  - [x] Decrease from mRNA to protein level
- [x] QTL P values are highly preserved at eQTL, rQTL, and pQTL (Pi1)

### Genetic regulation signals at different omics levels implicate schizophrenia pathogenesis
- [x] LDSC (QTL loci at different omics levels contribute to schizophrenia heritability)
- [x] MESC (integrating multi-omics data mediated the most heritability for schizophrenia)

### Running PrediXcan of different omics levels identify schizophrenia risk genes
- [x] Correlation of PrediXcan r2s at different omics levels (Multi-SNP QTL)
- [x] Compare r2 in PrediXcan original and conditional models
- [ ] For TWAS risk genes, how many were in the conditional models?
  - [ ] figure 3-24

### Integrating genetic regulation of multi-omics levels identifies schizophrenia risk genes
- [ ] meta analysis of TWAS at differemt omics levels
- [ ] colocalization of TWAS signals at different omics levels
- [ ] Joint-omics TWAS using MR-JTI

### Functional support of the schizophrenia risk genes
- [ ] HiC, enhancer, etc.
- [ ] drug target, known risk genes, etc.
